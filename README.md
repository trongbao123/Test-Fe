## Getting Started

1. If you do not have flutter sdk on your device, please click on the link and follow the instructions, if you do, please ignore:
   For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
   [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
   samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
2. After installing the sdk and flutter environment, open the command line and enter the command:

   > git clone https://github.com/trongbao123/Test-Fe.git

3. After you have cloned the project into the project directory, open a terminal window and type the command:

   > flutter run -d chrome

4. After running the command "flutter run -d chrome", Flutter will compile your application and open the Chrome browser to display it. You can interact with the application on the Chrome browser as you would with any web application.

Note: To run Flutter apps on Chrome browser, you need to make sure that your app is written to support the web platform. If you use Flutter native UIs specifically for mobile platforms, you need to adapt your source code to support the web platform or use compatible web UIs. And you need to follow the steps above.
